## User Story
This app is defined by registrated people, so registration and log in are a must. There need to be three types of people: regular user, blogger and an admin.
#### A Regular User
As a Regular User, I want to be able to have a page where I can search and find all bloggers and their blogs. Also I would like to have one special page dedicated only to bloggers that I exclusively follow, after all I need to be in touch with newly ideas that suit me. Probably one of the most necessary features is grading the bloggers posts, how else should we know if post is worth reading it. Also it would be nice if we could comment on that blogs so we can discuss them. Of course, not to forget, there also absolutely needs to my profile page with all of my settings including my username, list of people that I follow, etc.
#### Blogger
As a blogger I need everything as the regular user has, and a little bit more. My most precious tool as a blogger is a blogging form on which I can write date, name and of course blog context. Sure enough there should be a button to publish that new blog and probably another button to start new blog from fresh. Also it would be nice if in my settings, with all people that I follow, I could also see all people that follow me and my blogs. I almost forgot, since I don't like to repeat myself I should be able to see my blogging history so I don't give people the same things as I did in the past.
#### Admin
As an Admin my job is to moderate behaviour of users on the app. So, first of all I need to be able to do everything that a blogger can, with some minor differences. In fact since I decide which people can and can not become bloggers I should be able to receive regular users request in which they write some type of test blog from which I decide if they are good enough to become bloggers, or if they need to try harder next time. As for my connection with bloggers I should be able to delete their posts if they violate some of IT_Hive rules and also to take their blogger status away as a punishment.
